# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying

This repository demonstrates a common issue where Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply to components despite seemingly correct configuration.  The problem is related to build processes and how Tailwind interacts with frameworks.  See the `bug.js` file for the problematic code and `bugSolution.js` for the solution.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

## Problem

The `bug.js` file shows a simple component where Tailwind classes do not work, even after checking the `tailwind.config.js` and restarting the development server.
